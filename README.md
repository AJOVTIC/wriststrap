Wriststrap
==========
A Twitter Bootstrap inspired framework for [Appcelerator Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com) (Alloy)

### Version: Beta-1

About
-----
Wriststrap was born out of the need to quickly prototype and visualize mobile UI in the Appcelerator Titanium [Alloy framework](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#!/guide/Alloy_Framework).  With the creation of the Alloy, Titanium now has the ability to apply CSS class like attributes to UI elements (think HTML).  As with HTML this allow for a clean seperation from layout logic and application functionality (contained within JS files).  Wriststrap applies the same principles as Bootstrap in allowing non-visual designers (like myself) to create and layout a visually aesthetically pleasing looking mobile UI.


Supported Glyph libraries
-------------------------
Wriststrap has support for the following Glyph libraries:
* [Glyphish](http://www.glyphish.com/)
* [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/) (Free version)

### Glyph libraries installation:
Simply unzip the Glyph libraries in the `wriststrap/themes/wriststrap/assets` and name the directories appropriately (the name of the library all lower case, no version numbers just the name).  The framework will reference these locations for the images.
